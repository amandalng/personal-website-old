      <h3>Here's my life in a nutshell:</h3>
      <br>
      <p><strong>0/ I was born and bred in Jakarta</strong> as a (pseudo) <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/for-third-culture-kids-travel-is-home" target="_blank">third culture kid</a> who attended an international school and chose to compete at sports that were probably not the best fit for a girl so height-challenged</p>
      <p><strong>1/ I went to UC Berkeley</strong> where I majored in Economics and minored in (my best academic decision to date) <a href="https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/globalpov-can-experts-solve-poverty-76549/" target="_blank">Global Poverty & Practice</a>, graduating with good grades without rolling down 4.0 Hill like a fool</p>
      <p><strong>2/ I dabbled in work</strong> tweeting with other little birdies, supporting financial inclusion efforts in Indonesia, and coercing Berkeley kids to make their best academic decision to date</p>
      <p><strong>3/ I made a new home in Singapore</strong> spending my days eating chicken rice, nasi lemak, pizza, and Korean fried chicken, occasionally running to avoid waking up one day 3x what I currently weigh</p>
      <p><strong>4/ I kicked off my career</strong> as a management consultant at A.T. Kearney, where I spent two years roaming Southeast Asia helping big corporations solve their toughest operational and top-line growth issues</p>
      <p><strong>5/ I turned my passion project into a company</strong> called <a href="http://www.origoedu.com" target="_blank">Origo Edu</a>, an education consultancy that helps to fill a knowledge/resource/culture gap that exists in counseling systems across Indonesian high schools</p>
      <p><strong>6/ I became a (dog &#128062;) mom</strong> to the world's cutest Australian Labradoodle, who now has a higher like:follower ratio than I do (follow him today <a href="https://www.instagram.com/olliedood__/?hl=en" target="_blank">@olliedood__</a>!)</p>
